# InteliDoc MVP Demonstration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Cross-Platform Intelligence Agent MVP

This MVP demonstrates InteliDoc's vision as a **"Copilot for the entire enterprise"** - an AI agent that monitors and cross-validates data across all enterprise platforms (M365, SAP, Salesforce, Jira, etc.) while providing GRC cross-validation and discrepancy detection.

## ðŸš€ What This MVP Demonstrates

### Core Concept
- **Enterprise-Wide AI Monitoring**: Simulates monitoring 8 different enterprise platforms simultaneously
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: AI agent that understands context across systems
- **GRC Cross-Validation**: Automatically detects compliance discrepancies across platforms
- **Real-Time Insights**: Provides actionable intelligence for enterprise teams

### Platforms Monitored (Simulated)
1. **Microsoft 365** - SharePoint documents, Teams chats, Outlook emails
2. **SAP ERP** - Contract data, vendor information, financial records
3. **Salesforce CRM** - Opportunities, client requirements, deal information
4. **Jira** - Project tasks, compliance implementation items
5. **SharePoint** - Policy documents, security requirements
6. **Microsoft Teams** - Team discussions, compliance conversations
7. **Outlook** - Email communications, urgent alerts
8. **OneDrive** - File storage, policy documents

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
**"Today I'm demonstrating InteliDoc's cross-platform intelligence agent - think of it as Copilot, but for your entire enterprise ecosystem."**

**Key Points:**
- Monitors all enterprise platforms simultaneously
- Cross-validates data for GRC compliance
- Detects discrepancies and provides actionable insights
- Works across M365, SAP, Salesforce, and other SaaS tools

### 2. Cross-Platform Dashboard (3 minutes)
**Navigate to:** `/cross-platform`

**Demo Flow:**
1. **Overview Tab**: Show key metrics
   - "We're monitoring 8 platforms with 7 items analyzed"
   - "Found 4 GRC discrepancies, including 2 high-risk issues"
   - "Overall risk level is medium"

2. **Platforms Tab**: Show individual platform monitoring
   - "Each platform shows real-time activity"
   - "Different data types: documents, emails, tasks, contracts"
   - "User activity tracking across systems"

3. **GRC Discrepancies Tab**: Show cross-validation results
   - **High Risk**: "MFA requirement inconsistency between policy and vendor contract"
   - **Medium Risk**: "SOC2 mentioned but GDPR not addressed in EU deal"
   - **Medium Risk**: "Inconsistent data retention periods across documents"

4. **Intelligence Insights Tab**: Show AI-generated insights
   - "Cross-platform security requirements need standardization"
   - "Vendor management process requires immediate attention"
   - "GDPR compliance gaps identified in EU client deals"

### 3. Real-World Scenario Walkthrough (5 minutes)

**Scenario**: "Let me show you how this works in a real enterprise scenario..."

**Story**: 
- Company has a vendor contract in SAP allowing basic authentication
- Security policy in SharePoint requires MFA for all vendors
- Sales team discussing GDPR requirements in Teams for EU client
- Jira task created for SOC2 compliance implementation
- Email alert about vendor security review

**Cross-Platform Detection**:
1. **Security Discrepancy**: AI detects MFA policy vs. basic auth contract
2. **Compliance Gap**: SOC2 mentioned but GDPR requirements missing
3. **Data Retention**: Inconsistent periods (7 years vs. 2 years vs. 3 years)
4. **Vendor Risk**: Security review identifies urgent issues

### 4. API Demonstration (2 minutes)
**Show the underlying intelligence:**

```bash
# Get cross-platform intelligence report
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/cross-platform/intelligence-report

# Monitor all platforms
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/cross-platform/monitor

# Get GRC validation results
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/cross-platform/grc-validation
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Value Propositions to Highlight

### 1. **Enterprise-Wide Visibility**
- "Unlike Copilot which works within one platform, InteliDoc works across ALL your enterprise systems"
- "Single source of truth for compliance and requirements across the entire organization"

### 2. **GRC Cross-Validation**
- "Automatically detects when your SAP contract doesn't match your SharePoint policy"
- "Identifies compliance gaps before they become audit findings"
- "Cross-validates data across systems for consistency"

### 3. **Actionable Intelligence**
- "Not just monitoring - provides specific recommendations and actions"
- "Prioritizes issues by risk level and business impact"
- "Tracks resolution and provides audit trails"

### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
- "Continuously monitors all platforms for changes"
- "Immediate alerts when discrepancies are detected"
- "Live activity feed across all enterprise systems"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture Demo

### Backend Intelligence
```python
# Cross-platform agent monitors all systems
cross_platform_agent = CrossPlatformAgent()
items = await agent.monitor_platforms()
discrepancies = await agent.cross_validate_grc(items)
```

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Security Requirements**: Detects MFA policy vs. basic auth inconsistencies
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Identifies missing GDPR requirements in SOC2 deals
- **Data Retention**: Finds inconsistent retention periods across documents
- **Vendor Management**: Tracks security reviews and urgent issues

### Real-Time Processing
- Async monitoring of multiple platforms
- Cross-platform data correlation
- Intelligent discrepancy detection
- Risk assessment and prioritization

## ðŸ“Š Sample Data for Demo

### Simulated Enterprise Data
The MVP includes realistic simulated data across platforms:

**SharePoint Document**: "Vendor Security Policy v2.1" - Requires MFA
**SAP Contract**: "Vendor ABC Contract" - Allows basic authentication only
**Salesforce Opportunity**: "Client XYZ Deal" - Requires SOC2, EU data residency
**Jira Task**: "Implement SOC2 compliance controls" - MFA, audit logging
**Teams Chat**: "GDPR compliance discussion" - Data processing agreements
**Outlook Email**: "Vendor ABC Security Review - URGENT" - MFA requirements not met
**OneDrive Policy**: "Data Retention Policy" - 7 years for customer data

### Cross-Platform Discrepancies Detected
1. **High Risk**: MFA policy vs. basic auth contract
2. **Medium Risk**: SOC2 mentioned, GDPR missing
3. **Medium Risk**: Inconsistent retention periods
4. **High Risk**: Vendor security review urgent issues
